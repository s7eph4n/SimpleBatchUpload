The [SimpleBatchUpload][mw-simple-batch-upload] extension provides basic,
no-frills uploading of multiple files to MediaWiki.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.4 or later
- MediaWiki 1.26 or later

## Installation

The recommended way to install this extension is by using [Composer][composer].
Just add the following to the MediaWiki `composer.local.json` file and run
`php composer.phar update mediawiki/simple-batch-upload` from the MediaWiki
installation directory.

```json
{
	"require": {
		"mediawiki/simple-batch-upload": "~1.0"
	}
}
```

(Alternatively you can download a tar ball or zip file from
[GitHub](https://github.com/s7eph4n/SimpleBatchUpload/releases/latest)
and extract it into the `extensions` directory of your MediaWiki installation.)

Then add the following line to your `LocalSettings.php`:
```php
wfLoadExtension('SimpleBatchUpload');
```

## Customization

It is possible to specify dedicated upload pages for specific file types by
editing the _MediaWiki:Simplebatchupload-parameters_ page. Each line of
that page is considered as one set of parameters.

Available parameters are:
 * Name of template to be stored as text on initial upload
 * Upload comment
 * Title line of the Special:BatchUpload page

Parameters should be separated by pipes (|).

The line to be used is selected by appending the name of the template as the
subpage to the URL of the Special:BatchUpload page.

__Example:__

Consider the parameter line
```
Pics | These pics were uploaded using [[mw:Extension:SimpleBatchUpload{{!}}SimpleBatchUpload]] | Upload some pics!
```

* This can be selected by going to _Special:BatchUpload/Pics_.
* The title of this page will be _Upload some pics!_.
* The comment for the upload will be _These pics were uploaded using [[mw:Extension:SimpleBatchUpload{{!}}SimpleBatchUpload]]_.
* If a file with that name is uploaded for the first time it will have `{{Pics}}` as wikitext.
